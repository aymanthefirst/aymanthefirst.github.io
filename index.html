										<h2><a href="#">Project 3<br />
											Alfresco Digital Business Platform Deployment</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="/images/dbp.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project was a collaborative effort within an agile team, aimed at delivering a comprehensive and flexible solution to meet clients' diverse needs. It provided an opportunity to learn about various deployment methods such as Docker with Docker Compose and Kubernetes with Helm, as well as Single Sign-On (SSO) integration. The project's flexibility was further enhanced by ensuring compatibility with multiple SSO technologies and providers, such as Oath, PingFederate, Keycloak, Kerberos, and SAML.

										The main objective of the project was to streamline the deployment process of Alfresco Digital Business Platform, which encompasses several core products and shared services. Prior to this solution, clients had to deploy each Alfresco application individually, which relied on different technologies. This project not only simplified the deployment process but also showcased the use of cutting-edge technologies.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Project 4<br />
											Java webscripts for <br />
											Evergy</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="/images/evergy.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>As requested by Evergy, a leading energy company, I created Java Web Scripts to improve their content management system using Alfresco. The Web Scripts utilized the Alfresco Query Languages, Alfresco FTS and Alfresco CMIS, allowing users to search for content using various criteria such as keywords and metadata. The scripts exposed APIs for Evergy to utilize, providing a more efficient method for finding and downloading content. With the implementation of these Web Scripts, Evergy's content management efficiency was greatly improved, allowing their employees to focus on more productive tasks.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Project 5<br />
											Microsoft office Online Integration with Alfresco</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="/images/microsoft.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>As a member of an agile team, I worked collaboratively with my teammates to develop and test the app, which aimed to simplify collaboration by allowing users to save Office documents to Alfresco directly from Word, Excel, or PowerPoint desktop apps. My contributions to the project mainly focused on the front-end side of the app using AngularJS. I utilized my skills in front-end development to create a user-friendly interface that allowed users to save their Office documents to Alfresco with minimal effort. In addition, I played a critical role in the testing phase, utilizing Selenium with Protractor to verify the app's functionality and accuracy. By using this testing framework, I was able to ensure that the integration between Alfresco and Office desktop apps was seamless and error-free.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Project 6<br />
											Alfresco Transforms <br />
											core</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="/images/transform.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I was a vital member of an agile team that developed Alfresco Transform Core. My primary focus was on the backend side of the product, where I worked with Java to develop and test the various transform components needed for the product. Our team's main goal was to combine these components into a single core component, which involved transforming a lot of legacy code into newer, updated solutions. Through my efforts, I played a critical role in developing the core component and ensuring that it was tested thoroughly. Overall, I contributed to creating a valuable tool that helps organizations streamline their content.</p>
